# Notebooks Directory

This directory contains Jupyter notebooks for data exploration, analysis, and experimentation.

## Naming Convention

Use descriptive names with numbers for ordering:
- `01_data_exploration.ipynb`
- `02_feature_engineering.ipynb`
- `03_model_training.ipynb`
- `04_model_evaluation.ipynb`

## Best Practices

- Keep notebooks focused on a single task
- Use markdown cells to document your analysis
- Clear outputs before committing (consider using nbstripout)
- Move reusable code to the `src/` directory
